using exec() has unpredictable results

Using a non-current full episode has it return different formats for each act
Can probably be manuvered around.

rtmpe probably requires the swf file and the html page that embedded it.
Should try http whenever possible.


FFMPEG is stupid easy

mergeToFile(filename, tmpdir): concatenate multiple inputs

Use the input and mergeToFile methods on a command to concatenate multiple inputs to a single output file. The mergeToFile needs a temporary folder as its second argument.

ffmpeg('/path/to/part1.avi')
  .input('/path/to/part2.avi')
  .input('/path/to/part2.avi')
  .on('error', function(err) {
    console.log('An error occurred: ' + err.message);
  })
  .on('end', function() {
    console.log('Merging finished !');
  })
  .mergeToFile('/path/to/merged.avi', '/path/to/tempDir');

I found this insanely helpful tutorial for getting ffprobe installed on osx via brew:
http://www.renevolution.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-mac-os-x/

So, rebuilding with this:
brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvo-aacenc --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-schroedinger --with-speex --with-theora --with-tools

Issue:
i don't think it's really concatentating, I think it's just completely re-encoding.
Which is bad.

Apparently, I have to be using the concat filter, but fluent ffmpeg doesn't support that:
https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg/issues/376

The proper and fast way to concat:
https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate

Yes!
This works: ffmpeg -f concat -i <(for f in ./*.wav; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) -c copy output.wav

Interesting:

How I will probably invoke bash, with environment:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7464036/node-js-shell-script-and-arguments
Using exec(), because it lets you just do one string for process invokation.

But, I'm pretty sure I want the full bash environment.

Excellent example of how to execure a shell script with node.js:
